    "depth": "Same depth as container; do NOT plant deeper — crown must stay at soil level",
    "spacing": "4–6 ft apart within rows; rows 8–10 ft apart. Plant at least 2 different varieties for cross-pollination.",
    "ph": "4.5–5.2 — the single most critical factor. Blueberries WILL NOT thrive above pH 5.5.",
    "sun": "Full sun (6–8+ hrs). Tolerate light afternoon shade but yield drops significantly."
  },
  "water": {
    "in": "1–2",
    "note": "Consistent, even moisture is critical — blueberries have shallow roots and no root hairs. Drip irrigation is ideal. Mulch 3–4\" deep with pine bark or sawdust to retain moisture and maintain soil acidity. Never let plants dry out during fruit development."
  },
  "fertilizer": {
    "type": "Acid-forming fertilizer: ammonium sulfate (21-0-0) or azalea/blueberry-specific fertilizer. NEVER use calcium nitrate or wood ash — they raise pH.",
    "amount": "1 oz ammonium sulfate per year of plant age (max 8 oz per mature plant)",
    "freq": "Split into two applications: early spring at bud swell and again 6 weeks later. Stop fertilizing by July 1 to allow hardening before winter."

  "companions": {
    "good": [
      { "name": "Azaleas / Rhododendrons", "why": "Azaleas share the same acid soil requirements (pH 4.5–5.5) and companion planting them together creates a compatible acid soil zone that benefits both." },
      { "name": "Pine bark mulch (not a plant)", "why": "Pine bark or pine needle mulch gradually acidifies soil as it breaks down, maintaining the low pH blueberries require and suppressing weeds." },
      { "name": "Thyme", "why": "Thyme's low-growing habit makes an excellent ground cover between blueberry bushes, suppressing weeds and attracting beneficial pollinators." },
      { "name": "Strawberries", "why": "Strawberries share similar soil acidity preferences and coexist well around blueberry bushes as a ground cover, maximizing bed productivity." },
      { "name": "Clover (cover crop)", "why": "Crimson or white clover between rows fixes nitrogen and draws in bees, which dramatically improve blueberry pollination and yield." }

    "bad": [
      { "name": "Tomatoes", "why": "Tomatoes prefer near-neutral pH (6.0–6.8) and will fail in the highly acidic soil blueberries need; competing in a shared bed stunts both crops." },
      { "name": "Brassicas (kale, cabbage)", "why": "Brassicas require neutral-to-slightly-acidic soil and are allelopathically incompatible with blueberries at low pH levels." },
      { "name": "Nightshades (peppers, potatoes)", "why": "All Solanaceae prefer near-neutral pH and compete poorly with blueberries in acid conditions, and some share fungal root diseases." },
      { "name": "Grass (lawn grasses)", "why": "Lawn grasses compete aggressively for water and nutrients in the shallow root zone blueberries depend on, severely reducing yield." }

      "name": "Blueberry Stem Blight",

  "pests": "Birds — bird netting is the single most important pest control for blueberries; install before fruit colors. Spotted wing drosophila — fine mesh netting; harvest promptly when ripe. Blueberry tip borer — prune out wilted tips in spring and destroy. Blueberry stem gall wasp — prune and destroy galls. Aphids — neem oil spray; encourage ladybugs.",
  "animals": "Bumblebees are the most effective pollinators of blueberries (they 'buzz pollinate' releasing pollen). Plant pollinator habitat nearby. Ground beetles eat larvae. Birds eat many insects but also the fruit — use netting.",
  "rotation": {
    "family": "Ericaceae (perennial shrub)",
    "cycle": "Permanent planting — blueberry shrubs are productive for 20–50 years with proper care. Site selection is critical. If replanting, do not plant blueberries in the same location for at least 5 years due to soil-borne disease buildup. Rejuvenate old bushes by removing 1–2 of the oldest canes each year."

  "special": "SOIL pH IS EVERYTHING. Test soil before planting. If pH is above 5.5, lower it by incorporating elemental sulfur (1–2 lbs per 100 sq ft) several months before planting — pH cannot be dropped quickly. Retest and adjust annually. Zone 6 recommended varieties — Highbush (best yield): Bluecrop, Duke, Bluejay, Chandler, Elliott. Half-high (most cold-hardy): Northblue, Northcountry, Chippewa, Polaris. Plant at least 2 different varieties for cross-pollination — this can increase yields by 30–60%. Never plant in a low spot where cold air pools — late spring frost kills open blossoms.",
